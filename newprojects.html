                  <h6>Intrument Management App Interface Project</h6>
        <p>This project was done in Interaction Design at Simon Fraser University.</p>

<p>First we wanted to identify an issue area which may be solved by the creation of a new interface. After research we landed upon the idea of an app to be used by band classes to keep track of and sort instruments.</p>

<p>After doing this we did extensive research into existing interfaces that are in any way similar to our domain. We saved interfaces we liked as inspiration.</p>

<p>We identified the persona which was the music director. </p>

<p>In the next stage I started with the overall UX design of the interface. This is where I took time to design various outputs so that I could present my team with design layouts for our app, this was inspired by the previous inspiration step. We came together and combined our ideas finally landing on a final design and following style guide. </p>
                


<p>Finally we started making our wireframes and fully prototyping the full app. I took on the responsibility of prototyping the tutorial which is the first thing the user sees when interacting with our app. This is a very important feature in the user experience as it plays the role of the first impression and explaining how the app is used. </p>

<p>Next I prototyped the adding an instrument stream. This included various steps as it was important to properly document the instrument for inventory reasons. </p>
                
<p>My team mates prototyped the other streams and we came together with our first iteration. Next we moved onto our user testing phase where we tested our app and identified issues. </p>
                
<p>After identifying the issues I went in and fixed my streams along with the other streams. Finally we had our app created with the issues ironed out.</p> 

<p>Next we created a website to advertise our app and we presented this to our class. </p>

        <h6>Fluff & Fibre Website Project</h6>
        <p>This project was done in iat 339, my partner Rebecca Wong and I created a website for a brand called Fluff and Fiber which is a sustainable fashion forward company which specializes in organic fibers. We started by brainstorming the brand's identity and values. Then, we created personas to understand our target audience better.</p>


  <p>The first task was to create a style guide. I designed many buttons and color pallettes and came together with my partner to create a cohesive style guide.  </p>

  <p>Next we began creating the website. I worked on the home page, product page and the checkout page. I did this with HTML and CSS, I learned a lot about responsiveness and keeping my code cohesive and efficient. I learned the importance of having organized code which is readable and explainable.   </p>

  <p>I was very satisfied with the outcome of this project and believe our website showcased our HTML and CSS coding skills.   </p>
